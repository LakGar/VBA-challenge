# VBA Stock Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project involves creating a VBA script to analyze stock market data for multiple quarters. The script loops through each stock ticker in the dataset, calculates the quarterly change, percentage change, and total stock volume, and identifies the stocks with the greatest percentage increase, greatest percentage decrease, and greatest total volume.

## Features
- Loops through all stock tickers for each quarter.
- Calculates quarterly change, percentage change, and total stock volume.
- Applies conditional formatting to highlight positive and negative changes.
- Identifies and displays the stocks with the greatest percentage increase, decrease, and total volume.
- Outputs results to a summary table on each worksheet, including formatted percentage changes with a `%` sign.

## How to Run the VBA Script
1. Open the `Multiple_year_stock_data.xlsx` file in Excel.
2. Press `Option + F11` (on Mac) or `Alt + F11` (on Windows) to open the VBA editor.
3. Insert a new module by selecting `Insert` -> `Module`.
4. Copy and paste the provided VBA script into the new module.
5. Press `F5` to run the script, or assign the script to a button within Excel for easier execution.

The results will be generated in the summary columns (`I1` to `L` and `N1` to `O`) on each worksheet.
